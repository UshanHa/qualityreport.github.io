<h1>1) What does Quality Assurance mean for web site development?</h1>

<p>Answer: Quality Assurance ensures that end-users get a functional user interface and the best user experience when using a web app or website.

A website or web app is the business counter for any business that’s done online. As such, it should be a point of elegance and smooth operation. A website might be very intuitive and tastefully made, but it’s going to drive away customers if it doesn’t work as expected or is ridden with irritating bugs.
Quality Assurance (QA) ensures that end-users get a functional user interface and the best user experience when using a web app or website. It examines a website or web application to try and uncover any flaws that might have been overlooked during design and development.
Quality Assurance usually involves:
1) Requirement testing,

2) Design evaluation,

3) Functionality testing.</p>

<h1>2)Describe the two key principles of Quality Assurance: "Fit for Purpose" and "Right First Time."</h1>

<p>Answer: Quality assurance includes two principles: "Fit for purpose" (the product should be suitable for the intended purpose); and "right first time" (mistakes should be eliminated). QA includes management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and management, production and inspection processes.[7] The two principles also manifest before the background of developing (engineering) a novel technical product: The task of engineering is to make it work once, while the task of quality assurance is to make it work all the time</p>

<h1>3)How do web standard relate to web quality?</h1>


<p>Answer: Web Standards, and the documentation to support them, provide huge insight into ‘the why’ and ‘the what’ of the world wide web. They are a fantastic resource for any web developer and help people build stuff for the web that is functional, accessible and cross-compatible. They are Web languages, protocols and inter-operative and international technologies created with the purpose of guiding the Web towards its maximum potential through the development of standardized protocols and guidelines.

In order for the Web to reach its maximum potential, the most prominent Web technologies must be compatible with each other and allow any hardware and software to access the Web to work together.

Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. Without getting technical, simply it's the guideline for the mark-up language which determines how a web page. displays in a visitor's browser window.

The advantages in adhering to these standards are many:

Web pages will display in a wide variety of browsers and computers, including new technology like iPhones, Droids, iPads, PDA devices, mobile phones, which greatly increases the viewing audience.
W3C Standards promote the use of "Cascading Style Sheets" (CSS) or design code which is attached to the web page. rather than embedded in the page. The use of style sheets significantly reduces the page file size which means not only a faster page loading time but lower hosting costs for frequently visited sites due to using less bandwidth.
Design features such as colors and fonts can be easily changed by just modifying one style sheet instead of editing every individual page in a web site, reducing the costs to modify your site.
Search Engines are able to access and index pages designed to web standards with greater efficiency.</p>



<h1>4)Describe what Web Accessibility means. What steps you can take to make your pages more accessible?</h1>


<p>Answer: Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed</p>


<p>What steps you can take to make your pages more accessible?</p>

<p>1. Choose a content management system that supports accessibility.
There are many content management systems available to help you build your website. Common examples include Drupal and Wordpress, but there are many other options available.

Once you've chosen a CMS that suits your needs, make sure to choose a theme/template that is accessible. Consult the theme's documentation for notes on accessibility and tips for creating accessible content and layouts for that theme. Be sure to follow the same guidelines when selecting modules, plugins, or widgets.

For elements like editing toolbars and video players, make sure that they support creating accessible content. For example, editing toolbars should include options for headings and accessible tables, and video players should include closed captioning. The CMS administration options (such as creating a blog post or posting a comment) should be accessible as well.

2. Use headings correctly to organize the structure of your content.
Screen reader users can use heading structure to navigate content. By using headings correctly and strategically, the content of your website will be well-organized and easily interpreted by screen readers.

Be sure to adhere to the correct order of headings, and separate presentation from structure by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Do not pick a header just because it looks good visually (which can confuse screen reader users); instead, create a new CSS class to style your text.

Examples of proper use of headings:

Use h1 for the primary title of the page. Avoid using an h1 for anything other than the title of the website and the title of individual pages.
Use headings to indicate and organize your content structure.
Do not skip heading levels (e.g., go from an h1 to an h3), as screen reader users will wonder if content is missing.

3. Include proper alt text for images.
Alt text should be provided for images, so that screen reader users can understand the message conveyed by the use of images on the page. This is especially important for informative images (such as infographics). When creating the alt text, the text should contain the message you wish to convey through that image, and if the image includes text, that text should also be included in the alt.

The exception to this rule is when an image is used purely for decoration; in this case, the alt text can be left empty(link is external) so that the screen reader user is not distracted from the more important content on the page.

If an image is the only content of a link, the screen reader will read the file name if alt text is not provided. Always provide alt text for images that are used as links.

4. Give your links unique and descriptive names.
When including links in your content, use text that properly describes where the link will go. Using "click here" is not considered descriptive, and is ineffective for a screen reader user.

Just like sighted users scan the page for linked text, visually-impaired users can use their screen readers to scan for links. As a result, screen reader users often do not read the link within the context of the rest of the page. Using descriptive text properly explains the context of links to the screen reader user.

The most unique content of the link should be presented first, as screen reader users will often navigate the links list by searching via the first letter.

For example, if you are pointing visitors to a page called "About Us":

Try not to say: "Click here to read about our company."
Instead, say: "To learn more about our company, read About Us."

5. Use color with care.
The most common form of color deficiency, red-green color deficiency, affects approximately 8% of the population. Using ONLY colors such as these (especially to indicate required fields in a form) will prevent these individuals from understanding your message.

Other groups of people with disabilities, particularly users with learning disabilities, benefit greatly from color when used to distinguish and organize your content.

To satisfy both groups, use color, but also be sure to use other visual indicators, such as an asterisk or question mark. Be sure to also distinguish blocks of content from one another using visual separation (such as whitespace or borders).

There are several tools you can use to evaluate color contrast, which will assist you in making your page as visually usable as possible to individuals with low vision or varying levels of color blindness.

6. Design your forms for accessibility.
When form fields are not labeled appropriately, the screen reader user does not have the same cues available as the sighted user. It may be impossible to tell what type of content should be entered into a form field.

Each field in your form should have a well-positioned, descriptive label. For example, if the field is for a person's name, it should be labeled appropriately as either "Full Name" or have two separate fields labeled as "First Name" and "Last Name." Use the label tag or an ARIA property to associate the label text with the form field.

As you are going through a form field, a person should be able to tab through the form and fill out all the fields before getting to the "Submit" button, or they may not even realize that additional fields exist. Essentially, the tab order should follow the visual order.

If you have fields that are related or similar, consider grouping them together using fieldsets. For example, fields like "Full Name" and "Date of Birth" could be grouped together as "Personal Information." This type of form organization can help a screen reader user keep track of progress, and can provide the context that might be lost while filling out the form.

If certain form fields are required, the field should be labeled accordingly, and configured to alert the screen reader user. Commonly, required fields are noted as such with an asterisk, which will not be spoken by some screen readers. Asterisks (or similar visual indications) should still be used for sighted users, people with learning disabilities or people who speak English as a second language. Indicating that a field is required to a screen reader can be accomplished by adding ARIA required="true" and ARIA required="false" for optional fields. After submitting the form, user will need to be alerted to submission confirmation and any submission errors. We recommend including any error counts in the page title (after the user has submitted), so the user will immediately be informed that there are errors on the page. If a user submits a form with errors, the user should be brought to a submission page that indicates what the errors are, and provides an easy way to navigate to those errors.

Finally, the use of CAPTCHA is inaccessible and should not be used to validate submissions. WebAIM has a helpful summary of accessible alternative CAPTCHA to keep forms free of spam submissions.

7. Use tables for tabular data, not for layout.
Using tables for page layout adds additional verbosity to screen reader users. Whenever a screen reader encounters a table, the user is informed that there is a table with "x" number of columns and rows, which distracts from the content. Also, the content may be read in an order that does not match the visual order of the page. Do not create the layout of a website using a table; instead, use CSS for presentation.

When a data table is necessary (i.e. you have a set of data that is best interpreted in a table format, such as a bank statement), use headers for rows and columns, which helps explain the relationships of cells. Complex tables may have several cells within the table that have a unique relationship to each other, and these should be identified by using the "scope" attribute in HTML. Table captions (HTML5) can be used to give additional information to users about how best to read and understand the table relationships.

8. Ensure that all content can be accessed with the keyboard alone in a logical way.
Users with mobility disabilities, including repetitive stress injuries, may not be able to use a mouse or trackpad. These people are able to access content through the use of a keyboard by pressing the "tab" or "arrow" keys, or through the use of alternative input devices such as single-switch input or mouth stick. As a result, the tab order should match the visual order, so keyboard-only users are able to logically navigate through site content.

Long pages with lots of content should be broken up with anchor links (jump lists), allowing keyboard-only users to skip to relevant portions of the page without having to negotiate through other content. "Skip to main content" should be provided at the top of each page, so keyboard-only users won't have to tab through the page navigation in order to get the main content.

For pages with local menus and multiple levels and sub-items, the menus should be configured so that all menu items can be accessed with the keyboard. Do not use elements that only activate when a user hovers over items with a mouse, as keyboard-only or screen readers users will not be able to activate them.

9. Use ARIA roles and landmarks (but only when necessary).
ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a complex, powerful technical specification for adding accessibility information to elements that are not natively accessible. You should always use native HTML elements when they are available. Remember, the first rule of ARIA is “Don’t use ARIA.” Many functions that used to require ARIA attributes are now implemented in HTML5.

For example:

Use the native HTML button tag instead of the ARIA role of button.
Use the HTML label tag instead of aria-label or arial-labeledby.
Use the HTML 5 nav tag instead of the ARIA role of navigation.
ARIA attributes can be added to your HTML, in the same way that you add classes to HTML in order to load attributes from CSS.

Please note that just adding ARIA attributes is not sufficient to make most complex widgets accessible. ARIA does nothing for keyboard-only users (see #8 tip); it only affects people using assistive technology. You still need to set up your interactions and behaviors using Javascript.

Examples of appropriate ARIA usage include:

Adding alerts to notify screenreader users of dynamic page changes, such as stock tickers and search filters.
Making complex, interactive widgets such as date pickers accessible to screenreader users.
Return to Tips list

10. Make dynamic content accessible.
When content updates dynamically (i.e. without a page refresh), screen readers may not be aware. This includes screen overlays, lightboxes, in-page updates, popups, and modal dialogs. Keyboard-only users may be trapped in page overlays. Magnification software users might be zoomed in on the wrong section of the page.

These functions can easily be made accessible. Options include ARIA roles and alerts, as well as front-end development frameworks that specifically support accessibility.

Ensure that video players do not auto-play (non-consensual sound), and that the players can be used with a keyboard. Additionally, all videos must have options for closed captioning and transcripts for the hearing-impaired.

If your site contains a slideshow, make sure that each photo has alt text and can be navigated via the keyboard. If you are using any unique widgets (such as a calendar picker or drag-and-drops), be sure to test for accessibility.
